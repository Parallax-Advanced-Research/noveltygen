Novel External Agents:
    novel_external_agents_present: NO/can't
    novel_external_agents_not_present: NO/can't
Transition Novelty Type:
    new_change: Yes/trivial
        look for add effect or change fluent effect
    missing_change: Yes/trivial
        look for remove effect
    replaced_change: Yes/trivial.
        change fluent effect
    modified_change_rate: Yes/trivial
        look for change effect probability
    modified_change_size: Yes/trivial
        look for change fluent effect
Novel Entry Determinism:
    This section is tricky for me to understand formally
    deterministic: No/non-trivial:
        for all actions that could take the agent into novel, they will take the agent into novelty. Need to check effect probabilities.
        add effect with prob 1. remove or change effect that had prob 1.
    frequent_nondeterministic: No/trivial
        add effect or remove effect or change effect with .5 < prob < 1.
    infrequent_nondeterministic: No/trivial
        add effect or remove effect or change effect with 0 < prob < .5
    agent_caused: No/hard
        changes to events that are not related to agents actions.
Novelty Obviousness:
    Requires information on observation functionality of agents.
    alien_observation: No/Can't
        would have to match agent observation space to novelty
    entry_transition_discernible: No/Can't
        would have to match agent observation space to novelty
    novel_transition_discernible: Maybe, with multi step r-transformations
        Seems like we need to add a new predicate/fluent, and then use that as a precondition.
    novelty_region_inferable: No/Can't
        would have to match agent observation space to novelty
    novelty_region_investigable: No/Non-Trivial
        Need a set of transitions that can happen after novelty, but never in the original environment.
        Add an effect to an action that is the precondition of another action, where the negation is in the first actions preconditions.
    statistical_novelty_only: Yes/trivial
        Probability changes only. look for change_effect_probability.
    indistinguishable: No/Can't
        would have to match agent observation space to novelty
Novel Observation Determinism:
    This section is purely observation based, and we don't have a model of agent observations yet.
    deterministic: No/Can't
    frequent_nondeterministic: No/Can't
    infrequent_nondeterministic: No/Can't
Novelty Observation Localization:
    Requires information on agent observations and the policy they are acting on
    nearby:No/Can't
    distant:No/Can't
    mixed: No/Can't
Novel State Observation Activity:
    Requires information on observation functionality of agents.
    passive: No/Can't
    active: No/Can't
    resource_expenditure_required: No/Can't
Novelty Frequency:
    Requires information on observation functionality of agents.
    less_frequent_than_observation: No/Can't
    more_frequent_than_observation: No/Can't
    continuous: No/Can't
